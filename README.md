#iResume
July 2011, I made an Android App resume, in which there are some interesting things: an easter egg, some creative thoughts and a fantastic self-introduction (You can download the simple version except interesting things [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11369687/resume_normal_zh_en.apk)). I tried to apply for a position at my favorite company, but failed at last. I posted this experience on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/107460592910747948011/posts/Zh8DmNydD1d).

iResume is the simple version for iOS. And, it's an exercise to learn iOS development.
